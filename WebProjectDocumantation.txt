Transport & Management System
📍 Project Location
Head Office: Muğla, Turkey
🧭 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive web-based management system for a transportation company
that ships goods from Muğla to destinations worldwide.
It allows customers to request shipments, automatically calculates prices, optimizes container usage,
manages ships and trucks, tracks financial performance, monitors inventory, and generates full
business reports.
🎯 Project Objectives
1. Streamline transportation operations from order creation to delivery.
2. Automate cost, time, and distance calculations.
3. Optimize container capacity to reduce empty space and increase profit.
4. Manage the company’s ships and trucks, including travel expenses.
5. Track financial performance (revenue, expenses, tax, profit).
6. Monitor and control product inventory (e.g., blueberries by category).
7. Provide detailed analytics and comprehensive company reports.
👥 System Users
User Type Description
Customer Creates shipment requests, views price estimates, tracks shipments
Admin (Company User) Manages shipments, containers, vehicles, finances, inventory, and
reports
🌐 System Modules Overview
1. Customer Interface
• Home Page – company introduction, “Create Shipment” button.
• Product Upload Page – customer enters product details:
• Product name, category, weight (kg)
• Container type (Small, Medium, Large)
• Destination (city, country)
• Upload product image or details
• Price Calculation
• Base location: Muğla
• Price depends on distance and container type.
• Formula:
Total Price = Distance × Rate per km (based on container type)
• Example Rates
Container Type Capacity (kg) Price (₺/km)
Small 2,000 ₺5
Medium 5,000 ₺8
Large 10,000 ₺12
• Result Page: Shows calculated price, estimated delivery time, and order summary.
• Tracking Page: Customers can check shipment status using an order ID.
• Capacity: If capacity is full, there should be alert(ex: There is no enough space at small
container)
2. Container Optimization System
The company has limited containers. When multiple customers request smaller shipments, the
system groups them into the same container according to total capacity.
Algorithm Concept
• Sort shipments by weight (largest first).
• Place each shipment into the first container that has enough remaining capacity.
• When a container is full, it is marked as “Ready for Transport.”
Example:
You have a Large Container (10,000 kg) and customer orders:
• A: 2,000 kg
• B: 500 kg
• C: 200 kg
→ These three orders (2,700 kg total) are packed together; space left = 7,300 kg.
The system continues filling until optimal utilization is achieved.
3. Fleet Management
The company owns:
• 3 Ships for international deliveries
• 4 Trucks for domestic deliveries and port transfers
Each vehicle has defined capacity and operating costs.
Type Name Capacity
(kg)
Fuel
Cost/km
Crew/Driver
Cost Maintenance Total Expense
Ship BlueSea 100,000 ₺40 ₺20,000 ₺10,000 ₺70,000
Ship OceanStar 120,000 ₺50 ₺25,000 ₺12,000 ₺87,000
Ship AegeanWind 90,000 ₺35 ₺18,000 ₺8,000 ₺61,000
Truck RoadKing 10,000 ₺8 ₺3,000 ₺2,000 ₺8,000
Truck FastMove 12,000 ₺9 ₺3,500 ₺2,500 ₺9,000
Truck CargoPro 9,000 ₺7 ₺2,800 ₺2,000 ₺7,800
Truck HeavyLoad 15,000 ₺10 ₺4,000 ₺3,000 ₺10,500
Vehicle Expense Formula
Trip Expense = (Fuel Cost/km × Distance) + Crew/Driver + Maintenance
Example:
Ship “BlueSea” travels 2,000 km
→ Expense = (₺40 × 2,000) + ₺20,000 + ₺10,000 = ₺110,000
4. Financial Calculations
Metric Formula
Revenue Total of all completed shipment payments
Expenses Sum of all fleet costs + maintenance + other costs
Net Income Revenue − Expenses
Tax 20 % × Net Income
Profit After Tax Net Income − Tax
Example:
Item Value
Revenue ₺1,200,000
Total Fleet Expense ₺253,300
Item Value
Other Expenses ₺80,000
Net Income ₺866,700
Tax (20%) ₺173,340
Profit After Tax ₺693,360
5. Inventory Management
The company stores blueberries in multiple categories:
Category Quantity (kg) Minimum Stock Status
Fresh 4,500 2,000 ✅ OK
Frozen 1,200 1,000 ⚠️ Low
Organic 8,000 2,500 ✅ OK
When stock falls below the minimum, the system alerts:
⚠️ “Frozen blueberries stock running low — please restock.”
Inventory is automatically updated when shipments are created or fulfilled.
6. Comprehensive Reporting
The reporting module integrates financial, fleet, inventory, and shipment data.
Reports include:
• Total revenue, expenses, and tax
• Number of shipments
• Container utilization rate
• Most popular routes
• Total distance traveled
• Products sold per category
• Remaining inventory

🧮 Algorithms (Core Logic)
1. Distance Calculation: via Google Maps API (Muğla → Destination).
2. Price Calculation:
price = base_rate × distance × container_type_factor
3. Container Optimization:
Bin Packing Algorithm (First-Fit Decreasing).
4. Fleet Expense:
expense = (fuel_per_km × distance) + crew/driver + maintenance
5. Financial Summary:
revenue_sum, expenses_sum, tax = 0.2 × net_income
6. Inventory Update:
Subtract shipment quantity from stock after loading.

Use case:
Use Case Scenario: “Shipping Blueberries from Muğla to
Berlin”
Actors
1. Customer: Ali Yılmaz
2. Admin: Logistics Manager at the company
Step 1: Customer Creates Shipment
Goal: Ali wants to send 500 kg of fresh blueberries to Berlin.
Steps:
1. Ali logs into the Customer Portal.
2. Navigates to “Create Shipment” page.
3. Enters product details:
• Product: Fresh Blueberries
• Category: Fresh
• Weight: 500 kg
• Container Type: Small
• Destination: Berlin, Germany
• Uploads product image
4. The system calculates:
• Distance from Muğla → Berlin (via Google Maps API): 3,000 km
• Price = Distance × Rate per km for Small Container = 3,000 × ₺5 = ₺15,000
5. Ali reviews the order summary and estimated delivery time, then confirms shipment.
6. System updates inventory: subtracts 500 kg from Fresh Blueberries stock.
Outcome: Shipment is created with status “Pending”.
Step 2: Admin Optimizes Containers
Goal: Make efficient use of containers for multiple shipments.
Steps:
1. Admin logs into Admin Dashboard → Container Optimization.
2. System shows all pending shipments:
• Shipment A: 2,000 kg
• Shipment B: 500 kg (Ali’s order)
• Shipment C: 200 kg
3. Admin clicks “Optimize Containers”.
4. System runs First-Fit Decreasing Algorithm:
• Large container (10,000 kg) packed with A + B + C = 2,700 kg
• Remaining space = 7,300 kg
5. Container status updated to “Ready for Transport”.
Outcome: Shipments grouped efficiently, no wasted space.
Step 3: Fleet Management
Goal: Assign vehicles for shipment delivery.
Steps:
1. Admin selects Fleet Management → Ships/Trucks.
2. For Ali’s shipment (domestic truck → port → ship → international):
• Truck “RoadKing” carries 500 kg from Muğla to port.
• Ship “BlueSea” carries 2,700 kg to Berlin.
3. System calculates fleet expense:
• Truck: (₺8 × 100 km) + ₺3,000 + ₺2,000 = ₺5,800
• Ship: (₺40 × 3,000 km) + ₺20,000 + ₺10,000 = ₺150,000
Outcome: Fleet assigned efficiently; trip costs tracked.
Step 4: Financial Summary
Goal: Update company’s revenue, expenses, and profit.
Steps:
1. Admin navigates to Financial Dashboard.
2. System calculates:
• Revenue = ₺15,000 (Ali’s shipment) + other shipments
• Expenses = Truck + Ship + maintenance
• Net Income = Revenue − Expenses
• Tax = 20% of Net Income
• Profit After Tax = Net Income − Tax
Outcome: Company sees updated financial metrics, including Ali’s shipment contribution.
Step 5: Customer Tracks Shipment
Goal: Ali wants to check shipment status.
Steps:
1. Ali goes to Customer Portal → Tracking.
2. Enters Order ID.
3. System shows:
• Container: Large-1
• Status: Ready for Transport → In Transit → Delivered
• Estimated delivery time
Outcome: Customer stays informed; transparency increases satisfaction.
Step 6: Inventory Monitoring
Goal: Ensure stock levels are adequate.
Steps:
1. Admin checks Inventory Dashboard.
2. System shows:
• Fresh Blueberries: 4,000 kg ✅ OK
• Frozen Blueberries: 1,200 kg ⚠️ Low
• Organic Blueberries: 8,000 kg ✅ OK
3. Low-stock alerts prompt restocking orders.
Outcome: Inventory is always monitored; shortages avoided.
✅ Result:
• Shipment successfully created, optimized, and delivered.
• Container space maximized, fleet usage tracked, finances updated, inventory monitored.
• Both customer and admin have a smooth experience.
